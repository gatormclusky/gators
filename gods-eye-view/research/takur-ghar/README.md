# Takur Ghar 3D terrain (open-data build)

`takur_ghar_2002.glb` is a textured 3D model of the box 69.15-69.28 E, 33.30-33.40 N (about 12 x 11 km).
Open it in Blender, the three.js editor (https://threejs.org/editor/) or any glTF viewer. Units are metres, Y up,
north-up when viewed from above. Vertical exaggeration is x1.5.

| Layer | Source | Date | Resolution |
|---|---|---|---|
| Terrain | NASADEM (NASA reprocessing of SRTM), Planetary Computer `nasadem` | 20 Feb 2000 | ~31 m, no voids in this box |
| Texture | Landsat 7 ETM+ Collection 2 surface reflectance, LE07_L2SP_153037_20020913 | 13 Sep 2002 (0% cloud, snow-free) | 30 m |
| Texture fill (east edge) | LE07_L2SP_152037_20020922 | 22 Sep 2002 (0% cloud) | 30 m |
| **March texture** | LE07_L2SP_153037_20020305 (day after the battle, 5% scene cloud) | 5 Mar 2002 | 30 m |
| March fill (east edge) | LE07_L2SP_152037_20020314 (2% scene cloud) | 14 Mar 2002 | 30 m |

The March texture shows snow on the high ground and bare, dark valley floor. The east strip comes from the 14 Mar
pass, so seams and slightly different snow cover are possible there. (The 6 Mar Landsat 5 scene was tried for the fill
but has dark banding in the box's east, so it isn't used.)

Neither texture shows the battle itself. There is no wreckage, no people and no
winter conditions in this model. The texture is a snow-free late-summer view of bare ground. Heights are approximate
(SRTM error grows on steep slopes); the local high point in the DEM is 3,172 m versus the published 3,186 m.

## Viewer (switch between the two textures)

`viewer.html` loads the GLB with a button to swap the September and March textures, a vertical-exaggeration slider and
a red marker at the approximate summit. It needs a local web server and internet (three.js from a CDN):

    cd gods-eye-view/research/takur-ghar && python3 -m http.server 8000   # then open http://localhost:8000/viewer.html

Screenshots: `viewer_sep.png`, `viewer_mar.png`.

Rebuild: `./fetch_inputs.sh` then
`python3 build_scene.py NASADEM_HGT_n33e069.tif red.tif green.tif blue.tif --fill fill_red.tif fill_green.tif fill_blue.tif`
then `python3 render_preview.py takur_ghar_2002.glb preview`. For March run `./fetch_inputs.sh mar` and build with the
`mar_*` files and `--out takur_ghar_2002_mar.glb` (the viewer reuses the September mesh and only swaps the texture PNG). Needs rasterio, numpy, trimesh, pillow, matplotlib.

Also here: `dem_check.py` (void/slope check), `REQUESTS.md` (imagery requests and leads).
